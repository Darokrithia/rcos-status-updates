## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  Found two bugs, one is that debug mode must be clicked twice when the page is initialized, the second is that adding new parts is sometimes glitchy

## This Week's Plan

> Fix one or both of those bugs

## Anything Blocking?

> I am not sure what is causing those bugs, so I need to debug

## Notes

> N/A

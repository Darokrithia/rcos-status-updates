## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I added the ability to save as pdf and pulled this as well as the png stuff from last week.

## This Week's Plan

> Resolve conflicts and then look for a new issue.  Probably going to work on making a testing / play mode that can be toggeled and lets you test the circuit without modifying anything.

## Anything Blocking?

> The fact that I don't 100% know what I am going to work on.

## Notes

> I want to get 4 credits instead of 1.

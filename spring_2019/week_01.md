## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to learn a lot about sockets and websocket.io.  I was able to make a small app that
> runs a server on my computer and can chat with itself

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I hope to continue learning about websocket.io and improve my test app by letting it communicate with
> nearby devices.  

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Websockets is a fairly new technology to me and I am still learning about it.

## Notes

> Most likely everything I work on right now will later be deleted in later updates as I am just learning right
> now; however, I will still push every commit I make so it will still be visible in the git repo

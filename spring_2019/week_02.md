## Last Week's Accomplishments
> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I made it so that nearby users could use the chat app together across different devices and
> different platforms

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I hope to learn how to get Unity and or C# in general to use sockets.io  C# has its own sockets,
> but sockets.io only has API for javascript java and c++

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Again, I am new to this.  I am also not 100% sure how to approach this problem.  The C# not working is in
> itself a blocker, and as such has become my task for this week.

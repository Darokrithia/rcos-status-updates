## Last Week's Accomplishments
> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I tried to figure out why our chat app wasn't working over the wifi and tried to get C#
> and C++ to work together.  I realized RPI wifi blocks the sockets and found that getting C# to run C++
> code is rather difficult. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I hope to learn how to get Godot, which is what we will be switching too now that we have
> realized that WebSocketing isn't the best solution for us.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> For a third time, I am still new to this infact, I am restarting my learning as we are switching to Godot.

> RPI is also also literally blocking our sockets, which is the main reason for our switch to Godot
